– Image Processing: Utilized Python Imaging Library (PIL) to handle image input, processing the image in 128-bit chunks
for compatibility with AES encryption.
– AES Encryption: Implemented Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to encrypt each 128-bit image segment,
ensuring efficient and secure image data protection.
– RSA Key Encryption: Applied RSA algorithm to encrypt the AES key, enabling secure key transmission over insecure
channels.
– Hybrid Cryptosystem: Combined symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption to leverage the speed of AES for
bulk data and the secure key exchange of RSA.
